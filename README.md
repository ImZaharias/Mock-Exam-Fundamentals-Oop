## 📊 Exam Difficulty Evaluation

Based on the 60-question mock exam attempted:

- **Overall Difficulty Rating**: **7/10**
- The test contains realistic and well-structured questions, many of which require deep understanding of Salesforce platform fundamentals, Apex execution context, automation tools, and LWC architecture.
- Most questions are not "trick-based", but demand accurate knowledge of governor limits, trigger behavior, and best practices in development and testing.
- Multi-select questions and scenario-based cases elevate the challenge.
- Suitable for candidates who have completed at least 3–4 weeks of focused study, hands-on practice, and mock exams.

> 🧠 Recommendation: Review all incorrect answers thoroughly and reinforce weak categories like Process Automation and Apex context logic to push beyond the 68% passing score.
